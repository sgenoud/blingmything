# Why do you want me to sign this thing?

`pimpmything` as a project of the `replicad` family is a lot of work. I want to
have people benefit from it as much as possible. This means that I want it to
be open source. But I also want to be able to benefit from it if people build
a business on top of it.

So I went for a licensing scheme that uses AGPL so that the open source
community benefit from it, while asking contributor to sign this CLA so that
I can sell licenses exceptions to business who want to use the code without
disclosing the source.

I am not a lawyer, and might be completely wrong about my approach, please
contact me if I am doing something wrong here!
